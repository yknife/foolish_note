1. 正序

   ```aql
   for c in t_user
       sort c.name
       limit 10
       return c.name
   ```

2. 倒序

   ```aql
   for c in t_user
       sort c.name desc
       limit 10
       return c.name
   ```

3. 多字段排序

   ```aql
   for c in t_user
       filter c.surname
       sort c.surname,c.name 
       limit 10
       return {
           surname: c.surname,
           name: c.name
       }
   ```

   > Note that a filter is applied before sorting, to only let documents through, that actually feature a surname value (many don’t have it and would cause `null` values in the result).
   >
   > 注意：在sort之前的filter的作用过滤surname字段的null值

4. 数字类型字段排序

   ```
   FOR c IN Characters
       FILTER c.age
       SORT c.age
       LIMIT 10
       RETURN {
           name: c.name,
           age: c.age
       }
   ```

   > A filter is applied to avoid documents without age attribute. The remaining documents are sorted by age in ascending order, and the name and age of the ten youngest characters are returned.
   >
   > filter的作用是排除没有age字段的文档，剩下的文档将通过age字段正序排序，最后最年轻10个user的name和age将被返回。
